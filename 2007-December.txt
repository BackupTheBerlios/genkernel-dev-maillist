Subject: [Genkernel-dev] pre-root and post-root hooks
Message-ID: <52b8090f0712060809g190bfc93rf60da31f0a165bf5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was thinking of adding two directories: $LIBGMI/pre-root and
$LIBGMI/post-root.  The hook scripts would be much like the fsloaders,
with parameter parsing and help directives.  /init would run, you
guessed it, all scripts in pre-root after the network setup, and all
scripts in post-root after the union mounting is over.

Already, the "unpack" directive could be moved to a "post-root" hook.

kernel root=blah;blah; post-root=unpack:/mnt/tar1.gz:/mnt/tar2.gz;

Tim, probably the zonbu stuff could use such a scheme?

Subject: [Genkernel-dev] post-root hook: install modules to final root
Message-ID: <52b8090f0712060812s7d8fbdf7pdb12a2a38c943c75@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to make it easy to use a given vanilla distribution as a
read-only bottom layer and boot it with a genkernel kernel.  I believe
this would make it easy to turn any squashfs/loop image into some kind
of "LiveNFS" or "LiveHTTP" system, with gmi.

However, since the vanilla distribution squashfs does not include a
/lib/modules/<gk-kernel-version> tree, all modprobing done inside the
booted OS will fail.


To fix this, a possibility would be to

a) generate a cpio containing the whole generated /lib/modules and
insert it into the initramfs.  There is already a
--kernel-modules-cpio that does this, I believe.

b) Add a post-root hook, that would work like this :

if all modules are included in the initramfs (check for
/lib/modules/.../modules.dep)
    if root is read-write
        if root does not contain /lib/modules/<proper-version>
            copy from initramfs to the root/lib/modules/<proper-version>


Do you see any problems with this method?

Subject: [Genkernel-dev] Auto download distfiles
Message-ID: <52b8090f0712120629y30e5a5bbh3074cacf03349f08@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was wondering:

Should we auto-download distfiles or simply tell "please download it
from gk.org/dist/xyz and put it /var/tmp/gk-user/dist/"?

If we do auto-download, should we add some GPG signature checking to
prevent security and integrity problems?  In this case, files would
need to be signed with some kind of "gk maintainer key", and we would
need to distribute the public key with gk.  (Maybe it is overkill,
though.)  Another option would be to use SSL.  berlios.de has https :
we could simply check for the berlios certificate when downloading.

Please tell me how you would handle the distfiles problem, I will be
looking at implementing it soon (as I need to download the uclibc
tarball!).

Thanks,

genkernel now auto-downloads the needed packages from
https://genkernel.berlios.de/distfiles/ and places the packages in the
user's cache directory.

I have put (with Tim's help) some source packages online.  Eric, could
you add any missing packages? (aoetools, etc.)


About integrity verification...

It does not verify the SSL certificate, since the berlios.de
certificate is self-signed.  We cannot verify its authenticity with a
CA.

A GPG setup is an alternative, but is a little more complex.  It
requires distributing signed hashes and the required keys.  And
then... if we distribute gk with signed hashes from genkernel.org...
to verify other stuff downloaded from the very same website, it is a
little silly... how are the hashes any "safer"?  Ok, it is useful to
verify if there was transport corruption, maybe...

For now it goes over SSL but without certificate validation.  I
believe we get the transport corruption check with SSL.

I was pleased to see that The Havoc Pennington has a blog entry in
which he talks (but very little) about zonbu... which uses genkernel
as the base of its "statelessness".

Good job gk! :)
